I'm a dedicated, passionate and inquisitive Full Stack Web Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the consumer electronics and software industry. My specialties are in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React/Redux, NodeJs/Express, SQL, Python, MongoDB and GraphQL with the proven ability to learn and implement new technologies as needed within a team or solo project.

Over the past 10 years, I have leveraged my diverse experiences to excel and develop into a problem-solving, communicative and organized developer who is interested in combining those skills with web technologies to help build engaging and cutting-edge projects.

Currently I'm diving deeper into Back-End development with an emphasis in Javascript, Python, MongoDB & GraphQL everyday.</p>
